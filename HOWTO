How to add option models to OptionMatrix

1. Add enum entry in defs.h This enum list is preceded with the comment:
   /* list of all financial models */
   The newly added enum will have the same position relative to
   other models in the user interactive selection screen in the curses
   version (or combobox drop down in the Gtk+ version in linear list mode)
   as it has with the other enums.
   
2. In main.h create a definition in the:
   struct option_algorithm options_algorithms[] array initialization
   for the enum. The struct elements are listed in defs.h Its probably best
   to make a copy of a similar existing entry placing it in your new enum
   field then modifying it. This struct initialization entry should have
   the same sequence listing relative to other struct entries as the enum
   of all financial models mentioned above. A category field controls
   categorization in the combobox dropdown. See categories such as "0;BSM".
   
3. In options_calls.cpp / options_puts.cpp functions option_call() 
   and option_put() create case: statements for newly made enum. Call option
   function then break. If the option has associated greek functions update
   option_call_delta(), option_put_delta(), option_gamma(),
   option_gamma(), option_vega(), option_call_theta(),
   option_put_theta(), option_put_theta(), option_call_rho(),
   option_put_rho() in greeks.cpp

4. New source code should be added using autotools conventions.
   See Makefile.am files.
